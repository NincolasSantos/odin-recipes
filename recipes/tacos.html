        <img src="/repos/odin-recipes/assets/tacos.jpg">

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <h3><p>Most of us grew up eating ground beef tacos in a crispy corn shell or a soft flour tortilla, with lots of toppings.  That’s the traditional taco we’re making in this recipe.  But, we’re not using a pre-packaged taco seasoning mix.  This recipe uses a flavorful homemade taco seasoning.</p></h3>
