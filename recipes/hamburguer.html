    <ul>
        <li>Ground Chuck</li>
        <li>Crushed crackers or Panko bread crumbs</li>
        <li>Worcestershire sauce</li>

    <h2>Steps to make the recipe</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>First, set out a large mixing bowl and add in the ground beef, crushed crackers, egg, Worcestershire sauce,
            milk, and spices.</li>
        <br />
        <li>Next, press the meat down in the bowl, into an even disk. Use a knife to cut and divide the hamburger patty
            mixture into 6 – 1/3 pound grill or skillet patties, or 12 thin griddle patties. Like so:

            Set out a baking sheet, lined with wax paper or foil, to hold the patties. One at a time, gather the patty
            mix and press firmly into patties of your desired thickness. You typically want hamburger patties to be
            slightly larger than the buns they’ll be served on since they’ll shrink a bit in the cooking process.</li>
        <br />
        <li>Place the formed patties on the baking sheet. With thick patties, press a dent in the center of each patty,
            so they don’t puff up while cooking.

            You can stack the patties with sheets of wax paper between layers if needed.

            Then, preheat the grill or a skillet to medium heat, approximately 350-400 degrees F.</li>
        <br />
        <li>Best Burger Recipe Continued
            For thick patties: Grill or fry the patties for 3-4 minutes per side for a medium burger.</li>
        <br />
        <li>For thin patties: Cook on the griddle for 2 minutes per side.

            Ideally, you only want to flip your burgers once or twice during cooking.

            Pro Tip: Homemade cooked hamburger patties will keep well tightly wrapped in plastic wrap, or in an airtight
            container, in the fridge for up to 3 days, or in the freezer for up to 3 months.</li>
